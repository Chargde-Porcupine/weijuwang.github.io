**Jay Inslee**, Washington state governor, announced that all Washington school districts must offer hybrid learning for K-6 students by April 5. All other students must be offered hybrid learning by April 19.

In hybrid learning, parents/guardians may choose to have their children attend school in-person or remotely. This is a mix of in-person learning, where all students attend school in-person, and remote learning, where all students attend school virtually.

According to Dr.Reid, changes to the reopening schedule will be communicated to families next week. Families of students in grades 6-12 will also receive an "intent to return" form.
