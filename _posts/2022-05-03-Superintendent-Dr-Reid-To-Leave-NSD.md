On July 1, Northshore School District superintendent **Dr. Michelle Reid** will be leaving the Northshore School District. She will be replaced by an interim superintendent, who will serve for one year beginning in June. Searches for a permanent superintendent will commence in the fall.

The district has created [a survey](https://survey.k12insight.com/r/NSD22InterimSupeSurvey), open to all district community members until May 13, to "understand the type of leader who would best fit our districtâ€™s unique needs".

To protests and much controversy, Dr. Reid was accepted as superintendent in Fairfax County Public Schools of Virginia on April 14. Opposers of Dr. Reid's entry said she lacked familiarity with districts as large and diverse as FCPS, as well as the fact that there was a lack of transparency during the selection process. Supporters said the opposite - that she possessed an "early depth of knowledge about the challenges we face".
