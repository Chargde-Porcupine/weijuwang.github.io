title: "Student found with BB gun at Leota Middle School"
---

On Friday, Leota Middle School went into “Safe Inside mode” after a BB gun was found in a student’s backpack. During a Safe Inside, also known as a “Shelter in Place”, doors are locked but learning continues as normal. All students and staff were safe and a police investigation is ongoing.

Police and security on Leota’s campus will be increased as a precautionary measure. At the moment, police “do not see this as a threat, but rather as possible suspicious activity.”

Though rumors are circulating, there is no official information on who the student in question was nor what their motives were. In an email to parents, the school asked people to “allow the police to continue their investigation into this matter, and refrain from sharing unfounded rumors.”

Three other schools in the Seattle area experienced similar incidents and also went into Shelter in Place, including one in the district, Wellington Elementary.

This incident came only around a week after a string of mass shootings across the country, including the Uvalde shooting that killed 21, brought gun violence back to the forefront of American political discussion. Walkouts at Inglemoor and Bothell High occurred on Tuesday and Friday, respectively, to protest politicians’ inaction on gun violence, with turnouts of around 100 people each.

Stay safe; see something, say something. If you have information pertaining to this incident, report it to the King County’s non-emergency line, (206)-296–3311, monitored 24 hours a day, or the district at (885) 521–2665, [1414@alert1.us](mailto:1414@alert1.us), or their website [1414.alert1.us](1414.alert1.us). **For emergencies, call 911 immediately** or inform staff/admin during the school day.
