Hello! I'm a sophomore at [Inglemoor High School](https://inglemoor.nsd.org/){:target="_blank"}, north of Seattle. I code for our school's robotics team, [Valhallabots](https://frc3268.github.io/index.html){:target="_blank"}, and I recently became a copy editor for our school's nationally award-winning newspaper, [Nordic News](https://nordicnews.net){:target="_blank"}.

Though academia is important to me, most of what you'll see on this website are [projects](projects.md) I maintain outside of school. That's because I'm driven by raw passion and not just what will make me the most money in the future. (I don't have to worry about that quite yet.) Even so, I'm always looking for ways to turn my work from merely a passion project to something that can have a positive impact on the people around me, however small it may be.

As an example, I contribute to open source software on [Github](https://github.com/{{site.github_username}}){:target="_blank"}, both by uploading my own source code under free licenses and contributing to others' work, more recently. The open source community is amazing because people aren't paid, directly or at all, for their code -- they code because they can. Open source has powered a lot of the software development world's most influential projects, like [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Git](https://git-scm.com/){:target="_blank"}. I use a lot of open source software myself, and when I help maintain code for these projects, I'm both having fun and giving back at the same time.
