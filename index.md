Welcome!

I'm still working on my website and making sense of frontend stuff, especially Jekyll, which I have chosen for convenience. For now, this site will be completely empty.

I intend to have a couple of pages here in the future:
- Showcases of my projects
- Mini "news articles" I have been writing intermittently about local news
- Links to sites of other organizations I am a part of

For now, enjoy the deafening silence that remains the only thing this website has to offer, and thanks for reading.
