# Welcome to my website!

I'm still working on my website and making sense of web development, especially [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"}, which is the framework I'm using to help build this website. For now, this site will be a work-in-progress as I upload more content.

I intend to have a couple of additional pages here in the future:
- Showcases of my projects
- Links to sites of other organizations I am a part of

For now, please enjoy what little content this website has to offer, and thanks for reading.
