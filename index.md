# Welcome to my website!

This is my personal website. I'm still working on it and making sense of web development; for now, this site will be a work-in-progress as I upload more content.

You'll notice this page currently has a distinct lack of color -- in particular, graphics/images. This is perhaps paranoid of me, but it's because I want to do things right and sort out issues with copyright; that is, many of the photos I would like to use are also ones I am unsure of my rights to, so I have shied away from using them for now. Hopefully this will be sorted out soon, because this is looking bone-dry right now.

For now, please enjoy what little content this website has to offer, and thanks for reading.
