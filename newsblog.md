#### Purpose

I write these articles when I feel that there is news of importance to my community that has not been well-covered by other sources, or that I feel I could investigate and cover in more depth. Information is best when it is accessible to everyone, and I feel that, in an increasingly-globalized world, we focus too much on inter-community and not *intra*-community. In reality, both are equally important, and so I hope that my readers ultimately come away highly informed about the topics I cover.
