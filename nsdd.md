I created the Northshore Student Den as a means by which all Northshore students could chat and make friends without being limited to the social groups of their own school. Over time, the Den grew from "just" a Discord server to a massive, bustling community of 500 fellow students. I truly believe the server and the people who make it possible have had an impact on the entire Northshore community that is unlike any other.

The Northshore Student Den is driven by four principles:
1. **District-wide** -- All students in the district should be able to access the server with no discrimination or gatekeeping.
2. **For students, by students** -- There are enough clubs and school communities in existence, but the far majority of them are monitored or controlled in some way by parents, teachers, or other staff. It is therefore imperative that students have opportunities to show what they are capable of when working entirely independently.
3. **Freedom of speech** -- A community can only thrive and flourish if the people whom it comprises may express themselves freely. Opinions should not be restricted just because one disagrees with them; in fact, dissenting ideas should be encouraged to promote meaningful discussion of topics that are relevant to the Northshore community and beyond. A community with censorship is nothing but a dysfunctional community.
4. **Safety** -- People will not express their ideas if they do not feel safe doing so. This is not their fault; it is a community's duty to ensure that all its members are comfortable to speak their thoughts. Thus, there must not be tolerance for discriminatory or obscene content and language.

These four principles are constantly being kept in balance, and the server would not be what it is today if even one of them were lost. It is for that reason that I remain so passionate about maintaining the server. It has done for so many people from so many schools what many other clubs and "societies" cannot do: give people a voice and make them feel at home, no matter what they have to say.
